## Technical Requirements
The technical requirements for participating in the ACT Network's COVID-19 are as follows:
*	Twice a week refresh of [COVID subset of patients](https://github.com/shyamvis/covid-phenotyping/blob/master/inclusion-criteria.md) (and more patients if possible)
*	Addition of the [specialized COVID ontology](https://github.com/shyamvis/covid-phenotyping)

SQLServer flavored DDl and insert statements as provided by Barbara Benoit can be found [here](https://github.com/shyamvis/covid-phenotyping/blob/master/ACT_COVID19_Mart_Ont_SSMS.sql). ETL instructions will be posted on GitHub shortly.

Please refer to this [JIRA Ticket](https://actnetwork.atlassian.net/projects/ACT/issues/ACT-396?filter=addedrecently&orderby=created%20DESC) to replace SHRINE's existing tomcat/webapps/shrine-api/shrine-webclient/index.html. This change add a link to a web page tracking status of cCOVID-19 data available to help researchers interpret the numbers they are seeing.
