<p>A set of scripts for calculating and populating the c_totalnum field of the metadata tables can be found <a href="https://github.com/i2b2/i2b2-data/tree/master/edu.harvard.i2b2.data/Release_1-7/NewInstall/Metadata/scripts/procedures">here</a>.</p>

<p>These scripts are written for SQLServer and calculate patient counts across the entire local i2b2 instance. While not required, it is generally recommended that you populate the c_totalnum field for query performance reasons. Be sure to read the README file before running the scripts. These scripts were previously sent via email on Feb 19; the scripts posted above are identical.</p>
