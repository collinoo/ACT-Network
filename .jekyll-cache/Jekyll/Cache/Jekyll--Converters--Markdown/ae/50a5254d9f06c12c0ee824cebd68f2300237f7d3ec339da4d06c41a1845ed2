<p>The monthly ACT Metrics collection survey is on <a href="https://www.ctsiredcap.pitt.edu/redcap/surveys/?s=JPTYEE8AEP">RedCap</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Who completes the survey?</strong> Sites live with end users. Sites must complete the survey even if their number have not changed from the previous month.</p>

<p><strong>How often does the survey need completed?</strong> Monthly, by the second Friday of each month to capture data for the previous month. The survey will be sent to the data steward mailing list each month as a reminder.</p>

<p><strong>What if I didnâ€™t submit a previous monthâ€™s metrics?</strong> If you have not submitted a prior monthâ€™s metrics, feel free to fill out the survey as many times as necessary. When doing so, make sure you denote the appropriate month and date in the survey.</p>

<p><strong>How is this information used?</strong> Data collected is used for executive committee and NCATS reporting purposes, but we are evaluating how best to share this information back to participating ACT sites.</p>
